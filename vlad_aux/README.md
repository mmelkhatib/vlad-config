# Vlad Auxiliary shared folder

This directory is shared with the VM. Once in the VM you can find its equivalent at var/www/site/vlad_aux.

Vlad Aux is intended to provide an alternate route for files to be shared between host & guest without having to use your the main shared directory which is intended for your site's codebase and possibly in version control (defaults to 'docroot').
